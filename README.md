## ❄️ Frost Genetics System

### How It Works:
1. **Frost Events** occur randomly (10% chance after weather timer)
2. Plants accumulate **frost exposure** and **frost damage**
3. Each strain has different **frost resistance**:
   - Northern Lights: 80% resistant (hardy)
   - Sour Diesel: 50% resistant (moderate)
   - Purple Haze: 30% resistant (sensitive)

### Creating Frost-Resistant Strains:
**The Sweet Spot Strategy:**
- Let plant reach 50+ frost exposure
- Keep frost damage UNDER 20
- Harvest = **FROST RESISTANT** genetics!

**Bonuses:**
- ❄️ **FROST+** badge on plant and harvest
- **+5 potency** boost
- **+$5 per gram** value increase
- Unique collectible strain

### Frost Management:
- 🔥 **Warm button** (outdoor only)
  - Reduces frost damage by 30
  - Reduces frost exposure by 50
  - Use when damage gets too high
- **Strategic choice**: Treat early OR risk for genetics

## 🎨 Visual & UI Polish

### Graphics Improvements:
- ⚫ **Black canvas background** (reduced eye strain)
- **5-layer pot gradient** for depth
- **Segmented stems** with highlights
- **Detailed leaf veins** and structure
- **Frost coloring** on damaged leaves (blue tint)
- **Enhanced trichomes** on harvest-ready buds

### UI Enhancements:
- **Weather indicator** shows current conditions
- **Light status** displays ON/OFF and power%
- **Frost damage %** in plant details panel
- **FROST+** badge for resistant plants
- **7 buttons indoor** / **6 buttons outdoor**
- Larger control panel (140px height)
- Better button organization and spacing
