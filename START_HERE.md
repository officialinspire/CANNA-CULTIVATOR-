## 🎮 Game Mechanics Summary

### Core Loop:
1. **Select Strain** → Northern Lights, Sour Diesel, or Purple Haze
2. **Choose Location** → Indoor (controlled) or Outdoor (dynamic)
3. **Plant Seed** → Watch it grow through 4 stages
4. **Care for Plant**:
   - 💧 Water regularly
   - 🌱 Add Nitrogen (vegetative growth)
   - 🌸 Add Phosphorus (flowering)
   - 🍌 Add Potassium (overall health)
   - 🔫 Treat pests when needed
5. **Monitor Health**:
   - Yellow leaves = Need nitrogen
   - Purple leaves = Need phosphorus
   - Brown leaves = Need potassium
   - Droopy leaves = Too much water
   - Wilted leaves = Not enough water
   - Spotted leaves = Pests
6. **Harvest** → Females give buds, males give seeds
7. **Sell** → Make money to buy more supplies
8. **Expand** → Unlock new strains, grow multiple plants

### Resource Management:
- **Money**: Buy supplies, upgrade equipment
- **Water**: Keep plants hydrated
- **Nutrients**: N/P/K for optimal growth
- **Pesticide**: Treat infestations
- **Time**: Plants grow slowly (0.3x speed)

### Strategy Tips:
- **Indoor**: Safe, controlled, consistent results
